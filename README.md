# Polyp-Detection
This uses a boosted multi-scale feature fusion method for polyp detection task. The method is evaluated on the colonoscopy video dataset, in terms of metrics mAP and F1-score. In comparison with other state-of-the-art object detection methods, the method provides substantial improvements in both accuracy and efficiency, positioning it as a robust choice for real-time polyp detection in colonoscopy videos.

This uses Gold-Yolo model for the boosted multi-scale feature fusion method from below github.[link](https://github.com/huawei-noah/Efficient-Computing/tree/master/Detection/Gold-YOLO)
